Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
h2database,org.h2.util,God Component,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component contains high number of classes. Number of classes in the component are: 56
h2database,org.h2.util,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.h2.util; org.h2.engine
h2database,org.h2.util,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.h2.util; org.h2.engine; org.h2.table
h2database,org.h2.util,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.h2.util; org.h2.engine; org.h2.table; org.h2.value
h2database,org.h2.util,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.h2.engine; org.h2.value; org.h2; org.h2.mvstore; org.h2.jdbc; org.h2.tools; org.h2.mvstore.type; org.h2.security; org.h2.jdbcx; org.h2.mvstore.db; org.h2.store
h2database,org.h2.util,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
